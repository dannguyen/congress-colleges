<P><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#800040">BERGER, Victor Luitpold, </FONT>a Representative from Wisconsin; born in Nieder Rebbach, 

Austria-Hungary, February 28, 1860; attended the Gymnasia at Leutschau and the 

universities at Budapest and Vienna; immigrated to the United States in 1878 

with his parents, who settled near Bridgeport, Conn.; moved to Milwaukee, Wis., 

in 1880; taught school 1880-1890; editor of the Milwaukee Daily Vorwaerts 

1892-1898; editor of the Wahrheit, the Social Democratic Herald, and the 

Milwaukee Leader, being publisher of the last named at the time of his death; 

delegate to the People&#146;s Party Convention at St. Louis in 1896; one of the 

organizers of the Social Democracy in 1897 and of the Social Democratic Party 

in 1898, known since 1900 as the Socialist Party; unsuccessful candidate of the 

Socialist Party for election in 1904 to the Fifty-ninth Congress; elected a 

member of the charter convention of Milwaukee in 1907, and alderman at large in 

1910; elected as a Socialist to the Sixty-second Congress (March 4, 1911-March 

3, 1913); presented credentials as a Member-elect to the Sixty-sixth Congress, 

but the House by a resolution adopted on November 10, 1919, declared him not 

entitled to take the oath of office as a Representative or to hold a seat as 

such; having been opposed to the entrance of the United States in the First 

World War and having written articles expressing his opinion on that question, 

he was indicted in various places in the Federal courts, tried at Chicago, 

found guilty, and sentenced by Judge Kenesaw M. Landis in February 1919 to 

serve twenty years in the Federal penitentiary; this judgment was reversed by 

the United States Supreme Court in 1921, whereupon the Government withdrew all 

cases against him in 1922; his election to the Sixty-sixth Congress was 

unsuccessfully contested by Joseph P. Carney and the seat was declared vacant; 

presented credentials as a Member-elect to fill the vacancy caused by the 

action of the House and on January 10, 1920, the House again decided that he 

was not entitled to a seat in the Sixty-sixth Congress and declined to permit 

him to take the oath or qualify as a Representative; Henry H. Bodenstab 

unsuccessfully contested this election, and on February 25, 1921, the House 

again declared the seat vacant; elected as a Socialist to the Sixty-eighth, 

Sixty-ninth, and Seventieth Congresses (March 4, 1923-March 3, 1929); 

unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1928 to the Seventy-first Congress; 

resumed his editorial work; died in Milwaukee, Wis., August 7, 1929; interment 

in Forest Home Cemetery.

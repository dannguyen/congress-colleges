<P><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#800040">KITCHEN, Bethuel Middleton, </FONT>a Representative from West Virginia;  born in Ganotown, Berkeley County, Va. (now 

West Virginia), March 21, 1812;  attended the common schools;  engaged in agricultural pursuits and 

stock raising;  member of the Virginia house of delegates in 1861 and 1862;  served in the West 

Virginia State senate in 1864 and 1865;  presented credentials as a Member-elect to the Thirty-eighth 

Congress but was not permitted to qualify because the votes cast included those from Berkeley County, 

which was not mentioned in the act of Congress admitting West Virginia, and hence the assent of 

Congress had not yet been given, and the county was still a part of Virginia;  Lewis McKenzie 

contested the election, but inasmuch as the voting was confined to less than half the district neither 

claimant was admitted;  elected as a Republican to the Fortieth Congress (March 4, 1867-March 3, 

1869);  was not a candidate for renomination in 1868;  resumed his former pursuits;  president of the 

Agricultural and Mechanical Association of Berkeley, Jefferson, and Morgan Counties 1869-1875; 

master of West Virginia State Grange 1873-1879;  again a member of the West Virginia State senate in 

1878 and 1879;  president of the county court of Berkeley County, W.Va., 1880-1895;  died in 

Shanghai, Berkeley County, W.Va., December 15, 1895;  interment in the Presbyterian Churchyard.

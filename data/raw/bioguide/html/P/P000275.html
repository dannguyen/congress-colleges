elected as a Jacksonian to the Twenty-first and Twenty-second Congresses and served from March 4, 1829, until his death; 

during the campaign of 1830 his feeling regarding the United States bank issue precipitated a quarrel and subsequently a duel with Maj. Thomas Biddle, in which both fell mortally wounded; 

Mr. Pettis died the next day, August 28, 1831, in St. Louis; interment in the Old City Cemetery, St. Louis, Mo.
